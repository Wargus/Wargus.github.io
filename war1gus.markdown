### About War1gus

War1gus is a re-implementation of "Warcraft: Orcs & Humans" that allows you to
play Warcraft with the Stratagus engine. The game uses graphics and sounds from
the original Warcraft, but improves the gameplay mechanisms with many modern
conveniences that the Stratagus engine allows, such as modern mouse controls,
named groups, larger group selection, more player factions in multiplayer games,
a map editor, and multiple towns. This screenshot gives a feeling of what it is
like: ![](img/promoScreenWar1gus.png)

### Installation

During the first start of War1gus you will be asked for a copy of the original
Warcraft, so that the installer can extract the data. Both the DOS CD and Floppy
versions should work. Extracting the data from demo, shareware, or the Mac OS
versions is not fully supported at this time and the resulting data set will
fail to launch.

### Disclaimer

War1gus is not an official Blizzard product, its a Stratagus and Warcraft
modification, by Warcraft fans for Warcraft fans. You need a copy of the
original Warcraft.  Warcraft is a registered trademark of Blizzard
Entertainment.
