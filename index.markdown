### About Wargus

Wargus is a Warcraft2 Mod that allows you to play Warcraft2 with the Stratagus
engine. The game looks and sounds almost exactly like Warcraft2.  The gameplay
is very close to Warcraft2's gameplay, with slight enhancements towards
Starcraft and other more modern RTS games.

### Installation

On first launch you will be asked for a copy of the original Warcraft2, so that
the installer can extract the data.  There's also [a video
tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnY13i105LE&feature=youtu.be){:target="_blank"}
on how to install Wargus.

### The benefits of Wargus over original Warcraft 2

* You can play under Linux, MacOS X, and Windows.
* You can play in high resolution, with OpenGL shaders to improve or change the visuals
* You can play over the internet
* You can tweak many of the game's parameters using Lua language
* You can set game parameters right from the command line

### Disclaimer

Wargus is not an official Blizzard product, its a Warcraft2 modification, by
Warcraft2 fans for Warcraft2 fans. You need a copy of the original Warcraft2.
