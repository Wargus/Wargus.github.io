### About Wargus

Wargus is a Warcraft 2 Mod that allows you to play Warcraft 2 with the Stratagus
engine. The game looks and sounds almost exactly like Warcraft 2.  The gameplay
is very close to Warcraft 2's gameplay, with slight enhancements towards
Starcraft and other more modern RTS games.

### Installation

On first launch you will be asked for a copy of the original Warcraft2, so that
the installer can extract the data.  There are also video tutorials on how to install Wargus on Windows and Linux.
