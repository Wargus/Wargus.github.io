### About Wargus

Wargus is a Warcraft2 Mod that allows you to play Warcraft2 with the Stratagus
engine. The game looks and sounds almost exactly like Warcraft2.  The gameplay
is very close to Warcraft2's gameplay, with slight enhancements towards
Starcraft and other more modern RTS games.

### Installation

On first launch you will be asked for a copy of the original Warcraft2, so that
the installer can extract the data.  There's also [a video
tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnY13i105LE&feature=youtu.be){:target="_blank"}
